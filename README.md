# The Recipe Blog
The Recipe Blog is Website that I built using Dajngo Full Stack framework for my Portfolio Porject 4. The Recipe
Blog is a site that allows users to view and share their favourite recipies and also view and share their favourite wines.
They are able to comment underneath recipes and also like them. Users need to be logged in to get the full
functionality of the site.
