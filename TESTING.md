## Validator Testing

### HTML
- All the site pages were run through the W3C validator to check for any issues and HTML syntax errors. The W3C validator can be found [here](https://validator.w3.org/). As you can see from the below screenshots there are no errors.

### CSS
- The CSS stylesheet was put through the W3C Jiqsaw validator to see if there was any errors. The W3C Jiqsaw validator can be found [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)  .
- As you can see from the below screenshot of the result there were no errors.

### Python
- I tested the app using the PEP8 validator in gitpod, this I had installed from my previous project, but it can be installed by running **pip3 install pycodestyle** then searching for **Python**, Select **Linter** and then select **pycodestyle**. The PEP8 erorrs would then be underlined in red and also listed in **Problems tab**. This returned no errors.
- I also tested the site on **Code Institutes pep8 online** website. Which casn be found [here](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). As you can see from the below screenshots, no errors were found.

**#** Just to note, the settings.py file gave some **line too long** errors which are related to the default authorization, which I was told can be ignored in this file.
